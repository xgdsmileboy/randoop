Summary:

  Commons Primitives is a set of collection and utility classes for primitive types.
  The Java language has a clear distinction between Object and primitive types.
  A lot of functionality is provided for Object types, including the Java Collection Framework.
  Relatively little functionality is provided by the JDK for primitives.
  This package addresses this by providing a set of utility and collection classes for primitives.

  Commons Primitives is a component developed by Jakarta Commons, 
  a subproject of the Apache Jakarta project.

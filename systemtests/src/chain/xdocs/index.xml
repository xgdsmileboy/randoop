  <section name="Commons Chain">

      <p>A popular technique for organizing the execution of complex
      processing flows is the "Chain of Responsibility" pattern, as
      described (among many other places) in the classic "Gang of Four"
      design patterns book. Although the fundamental API contracts
      required to implement this design patten are extremely simple, it
      is useful to have a base API that facilitates using the pattern,
      and (more importantly) encouraging composition of command
      implementations from multiple diverse sources.</p>

      <p>Towards that end, the Chain API models a computation as a
      series of "commands" that can be combined into a "chain". The API
      for a command consists of a single method
      (<code>execute()</code>), which is passed a "context" parameter
      containing the dynamic state of the computation, and whose return
      value is a boolean that determines whether or not processing for
      the current chain has been completed (true), or whether
      processing should be delegated to the next command in the chain
      (false).</p>

      <p>The "context" abstraction is designed to isolate command
      implementations from the environment in which they are run (such
      as a command that can be used in either a Servlet or Portlet,
      without being tied directly to the API contracts of either of
      these environments). For commands that need to allocate resources
      prior to delegation, and then release them upon return (even if a
      delegated-to command throws an exception), the "filter" extension
      to "command" provides a <code>postprocess()</code> method for
      this cleanup. Finally, commands can be stored and looked up in a
      "catalog" to allow deferral of the decision on which command (or
      chain) is actually executed.</p>

      <p>To maximize the usefulness of the Chain of Responsibility
      pattern APIs, the fundamental interface contracts are defined in
      a manner with zero dependencies other than an appropriate JDK.
      Convenience base class implementations of these APIs are
      provided, as well as more specialized (but optional)
      implementations for the web environment (i.e. servlets and
      portlets). However, conditional compilation in the build script
      allows graceful creation of the underlying API JAR file even in
      the absence of the optional dependencies.</p>

      <p>Given that command implementations are designed to conform
      with these recommendations, it should be feasible to utilize the
      Chain of Responsibility APIs in the "front controller" of a web
      application framework (such as Struts), but also be able to use
      it in the business logic and persistence tiers to model complex
      computational requirements via composition. In addition,
      separation of a computation into discrete commands that operate
      on a general purpose context allows easier creation of commands
      that are unit testable, because the impact of executing a command
      can be directly measured by observing the corresponding state
      changes in the context that is supplied.</p>

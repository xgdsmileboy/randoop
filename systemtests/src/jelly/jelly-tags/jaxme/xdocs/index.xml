      <p>
        A <a href='http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/'>JAXB</a> tag library using the 
        <a href='http://ws.apache.org/jaxme'>Apache JaxMe</a> implementation.
        Tags are provided for marshalling java objects into xml 
        and unmarshalling xml into java objects which will work with any JAXB implementation.
        The generation tag generates java objects which can be marshalled and unmarshalled by
        JaxMe and are specific to that implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
          See the <a href="tags.html">tags</a> for more information.

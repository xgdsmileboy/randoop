This is an example of the kind of Rich User Interface you can create
using JellySwing.

The whole user interface can be specified using XML which can then be
executed using Jelly.

There is support for all the main Swing controls as well as custom controls.
Configure your views using XML techniques such as XSLT or Jelly, then 
plug in your own models or create new models dynamically using Jelly.

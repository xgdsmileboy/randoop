      <p>
        A tag library for validating XML using various schema languages like DTD, XML Schema, 
        Relax NG as well as Relax and TREX. This tag library uses the 
        <a href="http://iso-relax.sourceforge.net/JARV/">JARV</a> API to perform the validation.
        By default we use the 
        <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/xml/developers/multischema/">MSV</a> 
        library by Kohsuke Kawaguchi as the implementation of JARV.

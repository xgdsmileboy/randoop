    <p>GNU Trove: Decorators for java.util.{Map,Set} compatability</p>

    <p>The classes in this package serve to wrap the Trove primitive
    collections so that they can be used in operations that require a
    <tt>java.util.Map</tt> or <tt>java.util.Set</tt>.</p>

    <p>This is form of adaptation is <b>extremely</b> inefficient and
    so should only be undertaken as a last resort or when you don't
    care about performance (in which case Trove is probably not
    appropriate anyway).</p>

    <p>The general pattern here is that you "wrap" a Trove collection
    with the appropriate decorator object to obtain a java.util.Map or
    Set.  The implementations do not retain references to the Objects
    they accept/return (all calls are delegated to the underlying
    trove collection), so you should not rely on object identity
    within those collections.</p>

    <p>You may extend the decorator classes to use canonical values if
    your dataset permits.  For some applications, this will help
    reduce the cost of (un)wrapping primitive values.  Note, however,
    that such datasets are probably small/restricted enough that you
    should again ask yourself whether Trove is appropriate in the
    first place.  Caveat programmer.</p.

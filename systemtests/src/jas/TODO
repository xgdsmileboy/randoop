List of things to be resolved or accomplished:

issues to consider:

- implement polynomial factorization

- implement matrices to vector

- check for safe publication idiom in polynomial construction

- make hashCode to reuse computed value --> not immutable

- make polynomial chinese remainder generic (?)

- check the 187 exceptions (170 runtime exceptions) that are thrown

- implement parallel proxys for GB computation

- check solvable polynomials with integral domain coefficients

- use further util.concurrent algorithms where possible, e.g. in DHT

- refactor from BasicLinAlg to GenMatrix and GenVector 

- test caching results of gcd computation

- rework parallel GB algorithms

- refactor method names for groovy operator overloading, make examples for usage

- let arith implementations extend Power as abstract class
  add divide, subtract, abs, remainder to Power, 
  name e.g RingElemAbstract
  clean structure of compareTo, signum and equals
  - is not possible

- make final variables public (?)

- define divideAndRemainder in RingElem interface and implement
- rename divideAndRemainder to quotientRemainder

- make use of gcd in pseudo reduction, needs other coefficient type

- implement power series composition and power


partially resolved and completed issues:

- implement power series

- refactor ExpVector for different array element types

- implement comprehensive GB

- add product category to applications
- implement direct products of ring elements

- implement d- and e-reductions and d-/e-Groebner bases

- implement Groebner bases for regular rings

- implement term order optimization from MAS, also for coefficients 
  and solvable polynomials

- define power(n) in RingElem and implement in edu.jas.structure.Power 
  and classes, done

- define FieldElem and Field factory interfaces and use them for GB coefficients

- refactor Hensel lifting to ufd package, not possible because of 
  coefficient replacement trick

- check correct term order in recursive algorithms,
  in GCD ModEval only univariate cases are used, so term order is not a problem

- add assertions to check for number of polynomial variables and term order,
  nvar in GenPolynomial and GenSolvablePolynomial done

- make examples with rational function field coefficients, 
  e.g. raksanyi example

- incorporate gcd() in the Quotient class in edu.jas.application

- rework junit tests to stop failing in case of zero polynomials

- add version information in jas jar-file names

- develop modifiable polynomial constructor or put method and iterators



resolved and completed issues:

- refactor univPoly in solvable implementations, done

- add missing comments in edu.jas.Algebra*, done

- let inverse() throw a runtime exception, done; throw a checked exception (?)

- split ModInteger to ModIntegerRing factory, done

- make logger variables also final, done

- rename getval() to getVal() in ExpVector, done

- implement BigDecimal with RingElem interface, done

- replace thread-and-network-programming algorithms with 
  util.concurrent, done

- implement multivariate gcd, done

- add methods to GenPolynomialRing to construct x_i polynomials, done

- split RingFactory to ElemFactory, done

- split AlgebraicNumber to AlgebraicNumberRing factory, done

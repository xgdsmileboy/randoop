<h2>Computer Algebra Systems using Java</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://jscl-meditor.sourceforge.net/" target="rela">jscl-meditor</a>
    Java symbolic computing library and mathematical editor.
    The goal of this project is to provide a Java symbolic computing library 
    and a mathematical editor acting as a front-end to the former. 
    There are several computer algebra systems available on the market, 
    most of them developed in other languages, mainly C/C++ and Lisp. 
    But the benefits of using Java in symbolic computation are great. 
    Aside from being widely used and to comply with various standards, 
    this language has two features of concern: readability and portability.

    <a href="http://www.matheclipse.org" target="rela">MathEclipse</a>
    is a Java Computer Algebra system. MathEclipse has functions for 
    arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, matrices, vectors, finite sets, 
    derivatives, pattern-matching rewriting rules and functional programming.

    Java Tools and Libraries for the Advancement of Sciences.
    The system is not limited to computer algebra.

    <a href="http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/" target="rela">Singular</a>
    is a Computer Algebra System for polynomial computations 
    with special emphasis on the needs of commutative algebra, 
    algebraic geometry, and singularity theory.

<li><p>
    <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/" target="rela">Pari/GP</a>
    is a widely used computer algebra system designed for 
    fast computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, 
    elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of 
    other useful functions to compute with mathematical entities 
    such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers, etc., 
    and a lot of transcendental functions.

<h2>Computer Algebra Systems using other Object Oriented Programing Languages</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" target="rela">Sage</a>
    is an Open Source Mathematics Software
    creating a viable free open source alternative to
    Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab. 
    Sage is written in Python and Cython as an interface to 
    other open source CAS Singular, PARI/GP, GAP, gnuplot, Magma, and Maple.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/" target="rela">SymPy</a>
    is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
    It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) 
    while keeping the code as simple as possible in order 
    to be comprehensible and easily extensible. 
    SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://www.ginac.de/" target="rela">GiNaC</a>
    has been developed to become a replacement engine for xloops which 
    in the past was powered by the Maple CAS. Its design is revolutionary 
    in a sense that contrary to other CAS it does not try to 
    provide extensive algebraic capabilities and a simple programming language 
    but instead accepts a given language (C++) and extends it by a 
    set of algebraic capabilities.
    The name GiNaC is an iterated and recursive abbreviation for 
    GiNaC is Not a CAS, where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. 
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>
    <a href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/~peekas/cadabra/" target="rela">Cadabra</a>
    is a computer algebra system (CAS) designed specifically for the 
    solution of problems encountered in field theory.
    It has extensive functionality for tensor polynomial simplification 
    including multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables, 
    Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate dependence, 
    multiple index types and many more. 
    The input format is a subset of TeX. 
    Both a command-line and a graphical interface are available.
